for making the form and taking the input from the user 
1) first take the input controls 
2) options
   ->text
   ->password
   ->email
first we take the name and is important as we re login  in the system 
the name must match with the name which we enter earlier at the time of
sign up.
then second part password: note that the password is only hides but not 
encrypt the password so be carefull with this 
and last is the email which i required for login 

we need a submit button

3)form element controls where and how the information is sent
4)where is controlled by 'action' parameter
    - Defaults back to the same "page"
5)how is controlled by 'method' parameter
   -get puts from data in the URL
       >visible and replayable
   -post puts from data in the header
       >Hidden behind the scenes

<form method='post'>
  ....Input controls
</form>
if the method='get' it will get the input from the user and send to server side and again paste it to the url and display the contents and space is denoted by
'%'

if method='post' 

so what user type and send to the server side ??

there is no action parameter in the form tag because by defauls it goes back to the same page.
but action is used to redirect for the another page for the next steps 
after u submit u want to go for the different page we can use the action parameter

*********************************************************
Reading information on server:
>information is available in request.form collection
  -Names match the names on the input controls
   ----------------------------------------
  |   <input type='text' name='answer' />  |
   ----------------------------------------
 
name=request.form['answer']
